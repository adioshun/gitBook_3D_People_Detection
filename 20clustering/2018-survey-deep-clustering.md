# [A Survey of Clustering With Deep Learning: From the Perspective of Network Architecture](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8412085)


```
Clustering is a fundamental problem in many data-driven application domains, and clustering
performance highly depends on the quality of data representation. 

Hence, linear or non-linear feature transformations have been extensively used to learn a better data representation for clustering. 

In recent years, a lot of works focused on using deep neural networks to learn a clustering-friendly representation, resulting in a significant increase of clustering performance. 

In this paper, we give a systematic survey of clustering with deep learning in views of architecture. 

Specifically, 
- we first introduce the preliminary knowledge for better understanding of this field. 
- Then, a taxonomy of clustering with deep learning is proposed and some representative methods are introduced. 
- Finally, we propose some interesting future opportunities of clustering with deep learning and give some conclusion remarks.
